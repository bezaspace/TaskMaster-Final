Audio understanding

Gemini can analyze and understand audio input, enabling use cases like the following:

Describe, summarize, or answer questions about audio content.
Provide a transcription of the audio.
Analyze specific segments of the audio.
This guide shows you how to use the Gemini API to generate a text response to audio input.

Before you begin
Before calling the Gemini API, ensure you have your SDK of choice installed, and a Gemini API key configured and ready to use.

Input audio
You can provide audio data to Gemini in the following ways:

Upload an audio file before making a request to generateContent.
Pass inline audio data with the request to generateContent.
Upload an audio file
You can use the Files API to upload an audio file. Always use the Files API when the total request size (including the files, text prompt, system instructions, etc.) is larger than 20 MB.

The following code uploads an audio file and then uses the file in a call to generateContent.

Python
JavaScript
Go
REST

import {
  GoogleGenAI,
  createUserContent,
  createPartFromUri,
} from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const myfile = await ai.files.upload({
    file: "path/to/sample.mp3",
    config: { mimeType: "audio/mp3" },
  });

  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: createUserContent([
      createPartFromUri(myfile.uri, myfile.mimeType),
      "Describe this audio clip",
    ]),
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
To learn more about working with media files, see Files API.

Pass audio data inline
Instead of uploading an audio file, you can pass inline audio data in the request to generateContent:

Python
JavaScript
Go

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import * as fs from "node:fs";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});
const base64AudioFile = fs.readFileSync("path/to/small-sample.mp3", {
  encoding: "base64",
});

const contents = [
  { text: "Please summarize the audio." },
  {
    inlineData: {
      mimeType: "audio/mp3",
      data: base64AudioFile,
    },
  },
];

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  contents: contents,
});
console.log(response.text);
A few things to keep in mind about inline audio data:

The maximum request size is 20 MB, which includes text prompts, system instructions, and files provided inline. If your file's size will make the total request size exceed 20 MB, then use the Files API to upload an audio file for use in the request.
If you're using an audio sample multiple times, it's more efficient to upload an audio file.
Get a transcript
To get a transcript of audio data, just ask for it in the prompt:

Python
JavaScript
Go

import {
  GoogleGenAI,
  createUserContent,
  createPartFromUri,
} from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});
const myfile = await ai.files.upload({
  file: "path/to/sample.mp3",
  config: { mimeType: "audio/mpeg" },
});

const result = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
  contents: createUserContent([
    createPartFromUri(myfile.uri, myfile.mimeType),
    "Generate a transcript of the speech.",
  ]),
});
console.log("result.text=", result.text);
